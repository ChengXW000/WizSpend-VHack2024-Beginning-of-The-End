# WizSpend-VHack2024-Beginning-of-The-End
This is my submission to the V Hack 2024 tackling domain 2, with SDG 1 No Poverty. A finantial literacy word game that is designed to educate beginners or youths about money, finance, stock, insurance, interest and etc. And the relationship of money and hapiness. 

# About Wiz Spend
The code is fully based in C++, this is an text based financial literacy word game. The theme I am going for when designing this solution is to bring back the classical and nostalgia feeling of code. Bringing people back to the 80's where text based game are a huge thing with the addition of ASCII art as my UI for the project.
